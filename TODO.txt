TO DO list
----------

- Environment

- Baseline
write HF training script for baseline - RobeCzech with CNEC 2.0 and CHNEC datasets

test it on Metacentrum - interactive job
adapt qsub script
run training on Metacentrum first in fast 24 h queue, if necessary in slow queue

- Check CHNEC dataset
There are some errors in dataset, at least in lines 2752-2842 in validation dataset (CHNEC_v0.1_dev.conll) - person
surnames begin with I-p tag, B-p missing - possible solution -> patch file?
