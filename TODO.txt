TO DO list
----------
○ = done

- Environment
○ reinstall Hugging Face

- Baseline
○ write HF training script for baseline - RobeCzech with CNEC 2.0 and CHNEC datasets
○ test it locally, small batches initially
○ test it on Metacentrum - interactive job
○ adapt qsub script
○ run training on Metacentrum first in fast 24 h queue, if necessary in slow queue
○ fix pipeline problem in ner_pipeline:
fast_tokenizer = TokenizerFast.from_file(fast_tokenizer_file)
Exception: data did not match any variant of untagged enum ModelWrapper at line 103785 column 3
adapt baseline training script for config file use
○ run experiments on baseline: only CNEC 2.0, different learning rate, non-linear learning rate, more epochs, etc.

- Check CHNEC dataset
There are some errors in dataset, at least in lines 2752-2842 in validation dataset (CHNEC_v0.1_dev.conll) - person
surnames begin with I-p tag, B-p missing - possible solution -> patch file?
○ Also wrong annotation on line 16853 in train split: "Biůrger	DE	_	I-p" - lemma (2.) and language (3.) columns
are swapped

- Check RobeCzech vocab.json:
○ The OrderedVocab you are attempting to save contains a hole for index 51959, your vocabulary could be corrupted !
Fix: index of word 51960 changed to 51959, warning is gone
○ Fast tokenizer fails to initialize, throws error on BPE:
Exception: Error while initializing BPE: Token `Ġĕ` out of vocabulary
problem is with wrong vocab.json due to differences between Hugging Face and Fairseq
an email was sent to authors that can provide fix file

- Image dataset
○ use shared chronicles on the PERO-OCR web in future dataset and for creation of NE annotations by some model
download image documents: newspapers, chronicles, registry books, forms
annotate image documents in LabelStudio
create tool for page cropping - there are headers and footers polluting OCR output

- Text dataset
prepare loading script for SumeCzech-NER dataset

- LamBERT model adjustment

- LUKE model adjustment
