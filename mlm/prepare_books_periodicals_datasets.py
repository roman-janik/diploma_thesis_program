Pero OCR Books contains scanned and OCR-processed pages of books from PERO-OCR project. Pages are filtered
by OCR model confidence outputs. Confidence of each paragraph / ocr-region is calculated from line confidences.
Paragraphs with confidence <= 0.65 were filtered out. Pages with total lines <= 8 were filtered out too.
Pages were additionally filtered for language, keeping only Czech language. The decision if a page is in Czech language
or not is taken from first 5 paragraphs. If majority of these first 5 paragraphs are in Czech, page is included.
A language classifier model was employed.
